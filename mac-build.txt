Building cgminer on MacOS using Brew - tested on Big Sur 11.16
--------------------------------------------------------------

Install Apple Command Line Tools:
this can take 10 or more minutes to download from Apple

 xcode-select --install

Install Brew
this should take about 5-10 minutes on a recent mac with MBit internet

 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
 brew analytics off


Build cgminer:

 brew tap kanoi/cgminer
 brew install cgminer


If you already had brew installed, you should instead do the following steps:

 brew analytics off
 brew doctor
 brew update
 brew upgrade
 brew cleanup
 brew tap kanoi/cgminer
 brew install cgminer

To install minor updates to cgminer, if you already have upgraded everything

 brew reinstall cgminer


Accessing the API
-----------------

To access the API it is easiest to install Java
	https://java.com/

Ensure you have enabled the API e.g.
	--api-enable --api-allow "W:127.0.0.1"

Then in a terminal after installing and running cgminer:
	cd Library/Caches/Homebrew/cgminer--git/
	java API estats

Older macs
----------

If you are running an older mac without proper multitasking,
you may need to add the option --mac-yield when running cgminer with a gekko miner
